This is a CMS made in PHP to handle CODAME's specific needs. The architecture is inspired by Wordpress but lacks all the fluff, resulting in a fast scalable system for managing our content.

This is a specific solution to our specific problems but the code may be interesting or useful to others who want to build a custom CMS.

Features include:
- Continuity between artists, projects and events. An event page shows every project and artist that was there, and vice versa. Project pages show which artists work on them, and which events they were featured in.
- Chronological ordering for event posts.
- Automatic thumbnail generation.
