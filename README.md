# Custom CMS for CODAME Art+Tech

<img src="http://codame.com/assets/codame-website-screenshot.png" />

This is a CMS made in PHP to handle CODAME's specific needs. The architecture is inspired by Wordpress but lacks all the fluff, resulting in a fast scalable system for managing our content.

This is a specific solution to our specific problems but the code may be interesting or useful to others who want to build a custom CMS.

All the code for this CMS is freely usable under the MIT license, but please do not use the CODAME logo or brand in your own projects.
